# ASSGN_simple_linear_regression
Assignment of Simple linear regression on given data sets which are Salary dataset and Delivery dataset
I have performed all the necessery operations Like EDA(removing duplicates, replacing or eliminatig Null values from the data,rename the columns)
Also I performed the visualization garphs to determine the correlation between the target variable and independent variable
I have used all the models of Simple linear regression(SLR) like square model,square root model,log model,reciprocal model and compare their accuracy to picked up the precise model for the given data set.
